# Cloud Trace with PubSub
This repository contains the sample code that accompanies the medium article
called "Cloud Trace spanning PubSub".

It illustrates how to instrument a Java application with Cloud Trace and
publishes a message to PubSub that is then received by a second application
that continues the Cloud Trace trace record.
